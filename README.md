# kb-scripts

For the easiness of searchability, when you add the script to the repo, create the folder with the number of the article that corresponds to it, 
so the common hiererchy will be:
```
kb-scripts  
˪ 100210131  
| ˪ script.sh  
˪ 100210135  
  ˪ another_script.sh  
```  
Please keep the scripts organized!
