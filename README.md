# kb-scripts

For the easiness of searchability, when you add the script to the repo, create the folder with the number of the article that corresponds to it, 
so the common hierarchy structure will be:
```
kb-scripts  
˪ 100210131  
| ˪ script.sh  
˪ 100210135  
  ˪ another_script.sh  
```  
Please keep the scripts organized!

###To create a folder:

Click Add file > Create a file
Type the name of the folder in the input field, followed by a forward slash character.
Type the name of the new file you wish to create in the folder. Note: GitHub doesn’t allow the creation of empty folders.
